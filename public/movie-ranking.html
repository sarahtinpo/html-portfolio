<h1>The Best Movies According to Sarah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>

<p>I love the animation and love story between Sophie and Howl. It has a few comedic elements which I enjoyed watching too.</p>

<h3>The Painted Veil</h3>

<p>Beautiful melodramatic movie about a couple who regains their love for each other in a tragic setting.</p>

<h3>Miss Congeniality</h3>

<p>Tomboy meets pageant contest. Hilarious move starring Sandra Bullock who's one of my favourite actresses. I can almost memorise the entire script.</p>
